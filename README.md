## Design Choices and Libraries Used

In this project, I have made several design choices to ensure a modern and user-friendly application. Here are some of the key points:

- **Tailwind CSS**: I opted for Tailwind CSS for styling, which provides utility classes to quickly build custom designs without writing traditional CSS.
- **Modularization**: I followed a modular approach, breaking down this application into reusable components to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **Framer Motion**: For scroll-triggered animations of elements, I integrated Framer Motion, allowing for smooth and engaging transitions as users interact with the app.
